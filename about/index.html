<h2 id="who-am-i">Who Am I?</h2>
<p>Hi! I’m Juan, a biostatistics PhD candidate with a passion for data analysis, statistical modeling, and solving real-world problems in biology and health. Despite being in the middle of my PhD journey, I often feel like there’s still so much to learn—and that’s okay! This website is my space to document my progress, share my experiences, and reflect on the challenges and joys of learning biostatistics.</p>
<h2 id="why-this-website-exists">Why This Website Exists</h2>
<p>This website is my personal space for recording my journey through biostatistics, bioinformatics, tool exploration, and paper reading. I’m not an expert, and my thoughts might not always be correct, but I believe that regularly documenting my experiences and learnings will help me grow—and maybe even help others who are on a similar path.</p>
<p>The website serves two main purposes:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Personal Growth</strong>: By regularly recording my thoughts, notes, and experiences, I hope to solidify my understanding and track my progress over time.</li>
<li><strong>Sharing and Learning Together</strong>: I believe that learning is a collaborative process. By sharing my journey—including the mistakes and uncertainties—I hope to connect with others who are also navigating the vast world of biostatistics and bioinformatics.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="my-approach">My Approach</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Learning in Public</strong>: I’m inspired by the idea of sharing my journey openly, even if my understanding is incomplete or my thoughts are imperfect. This is a space for me to experiment, make mistakes, and learn from them.</li>
<li><strong>Tools and Techniques</strong>: I’ll share my experiences with bioinformatics tools, including what works, what doesn’t, and how I troubleshoot problems.</li>
<li><strong>Paper Reading</strong>: I’ll write about papers I’ve read, summarizing key points and reflecting on how they relate to my work or interests.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-youll-find-here">What You’ll Find Here</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tool Tutorials</strong>: My experiences with biostatistics and bioinformatics tools, including tips, tricks, and troubleshooting.</li>
<li><strong>Paper Summaries</strong>: Reflections on papers I’ve read, focusing on key takeaways and how they relate to my work or interests.</li>
<li><strong>Thoughts on Learning</strong>: Musings on the challenges of being a PhD candidate, the joy of discovery, and the never-ending process of learning.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="my-mindset">My Mindset</h2>
<p>I don’t consider myself an expert, and I’m often humbled by how much there is to learn. However, I believe that consistent effort and reflection can lead to growth. If you find any mistakes in my notes or have suggestions, feel free to reach out—I’d love to learn from you!</p>
